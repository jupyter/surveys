## Adding data to this repository

To add a dataset to this repository, please create a subdirectory with the syntax `YYYY-MM-short-description` under
the relevant top-level directory. For example, if it is survey data, create the folder under the `surveys` top-level
directory. In that directory, please create a new `README.md` file with a short description of the data, including:

* The date(s) it was collected
* Who collected the data
* What the population was (if human data), where the code can be found (if simulated data), or other relevant information about the source of the data

You may also wish to provide information about how to cite the dataset, such as a DOI. If you do not have a DOI, you can obtain one by uploading the dataset to a service such as [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/).
